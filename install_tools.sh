# Function to install Docker
# Note, using 'brew cask' to install docker doesn't work so well.
# It'll continuously prompt each time for creds to create / remove links.

# NOTE: 'brew install --cask docker' does not install cleanly, and prompts
# multiple times for credentials (and we cannot run brew with sudo). As an
# alternative,e we pull doen the .dmg.
#
# This approach requires us to install 'docker' and 'docker-credential-helper'
# CLI tools separately (which we've already covered above).
